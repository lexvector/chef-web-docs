.. tag resource_package_bff

Use the **bff_package** resource to manage packages for the AIX platform using the installp utility. When a package is installed from a local file, it must be added to the node using the **remote_file** or **cookbook_file** resources.

.. note:: A Backup File Format (BFF) package may not have a ``.bff`` file extension. The chef-client will still identify the correct provider to use based on the platform, regardless of the file extension.

.. end_tag

.. note:: .. tag notes_resource_based_on_package

          In many cases, it is better to use the **package** resource instead of this one. This is because when the **package** resource is used in a recipe, the chef-client will use details that are collected by Ohai at the start of the chef-client run to determine the correct package application. Using the **package** resource allows a recipe to be authored in a way that allows it to be used across many platforms.

          .. end_tag

*New in Chef Client 12.0.*

Syntax
=====================================================
.. tag resource_package_bff_syntax

A **bff_package** resource manages a package on a node, typically by installing it. The simplest use of the **bff_package** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   bff_package 'package_name'

which will install the named package using all of the default options and the default action (``:install``).

The full syntax for all of the properties that are available to the **bff_package** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   bff_package 'name' do
     notifies                   # see description
     options                    String
     package_name               String, Array # defaults to 'name' if not specified
     provider                   Chef::Provider::Package::Aix
     source                     String
     subscribes                 # see description
     timeout                    String, Integer
     version                    String, Array
     action                     Symbol # defaults to :install if not specified
   end

where

* ``bff_package`` tells the chef-client to manage a package
* ``'name'`` is the name of the package
* ``action`` identifies which steps the chef-client will take to bring the node into the desired state
* ``options``, ``package_name``, ``provider``, ``source``, ``timeout``, and ``version`` are properties of this resource, with the Ruby type shown. See "Properties" section below for more information about all of the properties that may be used with this resource.

.. end_tag

Actions
=====================================================
.. tag resource_package_bff_actions

This resource has the following actions:

``:install``
   Default. Install a package. If a version is specified, install the specified version of the package.

``:nothing``
   .. tag resources_common_actions_nothing

   Define this resource block to do nothing until notified by another resource to take action. When this resource is notified, this resource block is either run immediately or it is queued up to be run at the end of the chef-client run.

   .. end_tag

``:purge``
   Purge a package. This action typically removes the configuration files as well as the package.

``:remove``
   Remove a package.

.. end_tag

Properties
=====================================================
This resource has the following properties:

``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason. Default value: ``false``.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notify more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the chef-client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the very end of the chef-client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``options``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   One (or more) additional options that are passed to the command.

``package_name``
   **Ruby Types:** String, Array

   The name of the package. Default value: the ``name`` of the resource block See "Syntax" section above for more information.

``provider``
   **Ruby Type:** Chef Class

   Optional. Explicitly specifies a provider. See "Providers" section below for more information.

``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource. Default value: ``0``.

``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The retry delay (in seconds). Default value: ``2``.

``source``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Required. The path to a package in the local file system. The AIX platform requires ``source`` to be a local file system path because ``installp`` does not retrieve packages using HTTP or FTP.

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   Note that ``subscribes`` does not apply the specified action to the resource that it listens to - for example:

   .. code-block:: ruby

     file '/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt' do
        mode '0600'
        owner 'root'
     end

     service 'nginx' do
        subscribes :reload, 'file[/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt]', :immediately
     end

   In this case the ``subscribes`` property reloads the ``nginx`` service whenever its certificate file, located under ``/etc/nginx/ssl/example.crt``, is updated. ``subscribes`` does not make any changes to the certificate file itself, it merely listens for a change to the file, and executes the ``:reload`` action for its resource (in this example ``nginx``) when a change is detected.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the chef-client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the very end of the chef-client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``timeout``
   **Ruby Types:** String, Integer

   The amount of time (in seconds) to wait before timing out.

``version``
   **Ruby Types:** String, Array

   The version of a package to be installed or upgraded.

Providers
=====================================================
.. tag resources_common_provider

Where a resource represents a piece of the system (and its desired state), a provider defines the steps that are needed to bring that piece of the system from its current state into the desired state.

.. end_tag

.. tag resources_common_provider_attributes

The chef-client will determine the correct provider based on configuration data collected by Ohai at the start of the chef-client run. This configuration data is then mapped to a platform and an associated list of providers.

Generally, it's best to let the chef-client choose the provider, and this is (by far) the most common approach. However, in some cases, specifying a provider may be desirable. There are two approaches:

* Use a more specific short name---``yum_package "foo" do`` instead of ``package "foo" do``, ``script "foo" do`` instead of ``bash "foo" do``, and so on---when available
* Use ``declare_resource``. This replaces all previous use cases where the provider class was passed in through the ``provider`` property:

  .. code-block:: ruby

     pkg_resource = case node['platform_family']
       when "debian"
         :dpkg_package
       when "fedora", "rhel", "amazon"
         :rpm_package
       end

     pkg_path = ( pkg_resource == :dpkg_package ) ? "/tmp/foo.deb" : "/tmp/foo.rpm"

     declare_resource(pkg_resource, pkg_path) do
       action :install
     end

.. end_tag

.. tag resource_provider_list_note

For reference, the providers available for this resource are listed below. However please note that specifying a provider via its long name (such as ``Chef::Provider::Package``) using the ``provider`` property is not recommended. If a provider needs to be called manually, use one of the two approaches detailed above.

.. end_tag

.. tag resource_package_bff_providers

``Chef::Provider::Package``, ``package``
   When this short name is used, the chef-client will attempt to determine the correct provider during the chef-client run.

``Chef::Provider::Package::Aix``, ``bff_package``
   The provider for the AIX platform. Can be used with the ``options`` attribute.

.. end_tag

Examples
=====================================================
The following examples demonstrate various approaches for using resources in recipes. If you want to see examples of how Chef uses resources in recipes, take a closer look at the cookbooks that Chef authors and maintains: https://github.com/chef-cookbooks.

**Install a package**

.. tag resource_bff_package_install

.. To install a package:

The **bff_package** resource is the default package provider on the AIX platform. The base **package** resource may be used, and then when the platform is AIX, the chef-client will identify the correct package provider. The following examples show how to install part of the IBM XL C/C++ compiler.

Using the base **package** resource:

.. code-block:: ruby

   package 'xlccmp.13.1.0' do
     source '/var/tmp/IBM_XL_C_13.1.0/usr/sys/inst.images/xlccmp.13.1.0'
     action :install
   end

Using the **bff_package** resource:

.. code-block:: ruby

   bff_package 'xlccmp.13.1.0' do
     source '/var/tmp/IBM_XL_C_13.1.0/usr/sys/inst.images/xlccmp.13.1.0'
     action :install
   end

.. end_tag
